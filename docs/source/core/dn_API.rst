Dummy Nodes

Here you can find a description of all the scripts that implement simplified versions of some cognitive nodes.
The idea is to have cognitive nodes as barebones as possible to run experiments where we only want to focus on 
a specific cognitive node variation / algorithm.

Python scripts for the implementation of dummy nodes.
The dummy nodes avaliable are:

**Drive**

.. automodule:: dummy_nodes.dummy_drive
    :members:
    :show-inheritance:

**Goal**

.. automodule:: dummy_nodes.dummy_goal
    :members:
    :show-inheritance:

**P-Node**

.. automodule:: dummy_nodes.dummy_pnodes
    :members:
    :show-inheritance:
