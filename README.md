# e-MDB Core components

Note:

***WORK IN PROGRESS***

The original repository has been split in 5 and we are refactoring everything, please, be patient while we move and rename everything.

These are the cognitive architecture repositories for PILLAR and their content:

- _emdb_core_. Essential elements of the cognitive architecture. These are necessary to run an experiment using the cognitive architecture.
- _emdb_cognitive_nodes_gii_. Reference implementation for the main cognitive nodes.
- _emdb_cognitive_processes_gii_. Reference implementation for the main cognitive processes.
- _emdb_discrete_event_simulator_gii_. Implementation of a discrete event simulator used in many experiments.
- _emdb_experiments_gii_. Configuration files for experiments.

## Design

![layered_cognitive_architecture_view](assets/emdb_layered_architecture_01.svg)

In this simplified static view, we can see the main software layers that define how software developments should be organized. The following abstraction layers are considered:

- ROS2 middleware. This cognitive architecture relies on ROS2 as the development framework for the communications and the process execution model.
- Execution middleware. Abstraction layer for managing the execution of cognitive nodes on different threads and computers.
- Long-term memory (LTM) and cognitive nodes. The LTM component is responsible for keeping a record of the specific cognitive nodes that are currently available, organized by their type. This layer also contains the different types of cognitive nodes.
- Cognitive processes. This is the layer designed for the implementation of particular cognitive processes, which use the cognitive nodes currently registered in the LTM.
- ROS interfaces. This is not an actual layer but indicates the need to include in each layer well-defined and documented interfaces that abstract access (local or remote) to the specific components included in the architecture, particularly cognitive nodes and cognitive processes.

In this figure we can see a more detailed view of the design of the core of the architecture:

- Execution nodes. They are responsible for executing the cognitive nodes in a configurable single-thread or multi-thread fashion using some load balancing strategy.
- Commander node. A client component cannot directly manage the execution nodes. Instead, it interacts with the Commander node fa√ßade through its ROS2 interface (services and topics).
- Cognitive nodes. The architecture must necessarily include at least one package with an implementation of specific cognitive nodes of the cognitive mechanism: perceptions, policies, needs, goals, etc. The current reference implementation is in the [emdb_cognitive_nodes_gii repository](https://github.com/GII/emdb_cognitive_nodes_gii), but it is possible to replace it with another one that fulfill the same interface.
- Cognitive processes. The current reference implementation is in the [emdb_cognitive_processes_gii repository](https://github.com/GII/emdb_cognitive_processes_gii). Right now, there is only one process, the Main Cognitive Loop. This process handles the classical e-MDB loop: reading perceptions, calculation of activations (determining relevant contexts), selecting policies, and executing policies.
